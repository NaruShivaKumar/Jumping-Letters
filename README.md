# Jumping-Letters

A jumping letters web project employs HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to animate text dynamically. JavaScript manipulates individual letters, enabling effects like bouncing, scaling, or rotations. Libraries such as Anime.js or GSAP streamline animation creation.
HTML structures the text placement, CSS styles it, and JavaScript orchestrates animations and user interactions. Performance considerations ensure smooth animations without overloading devices. Optimizing code, efficient animation techniques, and cross-device testing maintain a seamless user experience.
This project offers a creative, engaging, and visually stimulating experience for webpage visitors, using simple yet impactful techniques to animate text dynamically.
